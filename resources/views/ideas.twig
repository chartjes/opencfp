    <h2>Call for Papers Talk Ideas</h2>
    <p>
        {{ site.title }} sessions cover a wide range of topics related to Open Source, Open Hardware,
		Open Standards, and Open Data. We encourage you to "think outside the box" to come up with your
        own unique topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to financial constraints most conferences tend to pick speakers to present
        multiple talks. Therefore <strong>it is advisable to submit a few talk ideas, not just one.</strong>
        By submitting a single talk you may lessen your chances of being selected.
    </p>

        To get the ideas flowing, here's a few suggestions:
