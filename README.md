 * Either the GD image library or the Imagick PHP extension for the [Intervention image library](http://image.intervention.io/getting_started/installation))

## [Privacy Restrictions](#privacy)

We request that anyone who installs OpenCFP to not share any of the 
personal information that is collected from users with any third
parties without explicit permission from users and to also be aware of the existence of the European
Union's [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)
as it could potentially impact your ability to accept submissions
from anyone residing within the European Union.

Tools to make it easier to comply with the GDPR are in the process
of being created.

We recommend that you delete any data stored in a database associated
with an OpenCFP instance within 15 months of accepting submissions from
users.


## [Installation](#installation)

### [Grab Latest Release](#grab-latest-release)

It is recommended for you to always install the latest marked release. Go to `https://github.com/opencfp/opencfp/releases` to download it.

### [Cloning the Repository](#cloning-the-repository)

Clone this project into your working directory. We recommend always running the `master` branch as it was frequent contributions.

Example:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:opencfp/opencfp.git
Cloning into 'opencfp'...
remote: Counting objects: 4794, done.
remote: Total 4794 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (4794/4794), 1.59 MiB | 10.37 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (2314/2314), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

### [Specify Environment](#specify-environment)

OpenCFP can be configured to run in multiple environments. The application environment (`CFP_ENV`) must be specified
as an environment variable. If not specified, the default is `development`.

An example Apache configuration is provided at `/web/htaccess.dist`. Copy this file to `/web/.htaccess` or otherwise
configure your web server in the same way and change the `CFP_ENV` value to specify a different environment. The
default has been pre-set for development.

```
SetEnv CFP_ENV production
```

You will also need to set the `CFP_ENV` variable in the shell you are using when doing an install. Here are some
ways to do that with common shells assuming we're using `production`:

* bash: `export CFP_ENV=production`
* zsh:  `export CFP_ENV = production`
* fish: `set -x CFP_ENV production`

Again, just use your preferred environment in place of `production` if required.

### [Installing Composer Dependencies](#installing-composer-dependencies)

From the project directory, run the following command. You may need to download `composer.phar` first from http://getcomposer.org

```bash
$ php composer.phar run setup-env
```

If you have composer installed globally you can run:

```bash
$ composer run setup-env
```

Or you can run

```bash
$ ./script/setup
```

Due to current dependencies you will see the following warning message when installing
this project's dependencies via Composer:

```bash
Carbon 1 is deprecated, see how to migrate to Carbon 2.
https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-carbon-2
    You can run './vendor/bin/upgrade-carbon' to get help in updating carbon and other frameworks and libraries that depend on it.
```


### [Specify Web Server Document Root](#specify-web-server-document-root)

Set up your desired webserver to point to the `/web` directory.

[Apache 2+](https://httpd.apache.org/) Example:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot /path/to/web
    ServerName cfp.conference.com

    # Other Directives Here
</VirtualHost>
```

nginx Example:

```
server {
	server_name cfp.sitename.com;
	root /var/www/opencfp/web;
	listen 80;
	index index.php index.html index.htm;

	access_log /var/log/nginx/access.cfp.log;
	error_log /var/log/nginx/error.cfp.log;

	location / {
		try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
	}

	location ~ \.php$ {
		try_files $uri =404;

		fastcgi_param CFP_ENV production;
		fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
		fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php71-fpm.sock;
		fastcgi_read_timeout 150;
		fastcgi_index index.php;
		fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
		include fastcgi_params;
	}

}
```

### [Running Locally](#running-locally)

After having gone through the setup steps and database migrations, you can test out OpenCFP locally by installing the [Symfony binary](https://symfony.com/download)
and using the following command:

```
symfony server:start
```

By default it should start up a web server running your site at `https://127.0.0.1:8000`

### [Create a Database](#create-a-database)

Create a new database for the application to use. You will need to have the following handy to continue configuring
your installation of OpenCFP:

 * Database server hostname
 * Database name
 * Credentials to an account that can access the above database


### [Configure Environment](#configure-environment)

Depending on which environment you specified above, you will need to make a copy of the distributed configuration
schema to enter your own details into.

For example, if you specified `SetEnv CFP_ENV production`:

```bash
$ cp config/production.yml.dist config/production.yml
```

After making a local copy, edit `config/production.yml` and specify your own details. Here are some important options
to consider:

| Option                | Description                       |
|:----------------------|:----------------------------------|
| `application.enddate` | This is the date your call for proposals would end on. |
| `application.coc_link`| Set this to the link for your conference code of conduct to require speakers to agree to the code of conduct at registration |
| `secure_ssl`          | This should be enabled, if possible. Requires a valid SSL certificate. |
| `database.*`          | This is the database information you collected above. |
| `mail.*`              | This is SMTP configuration for sending mail. The application sends notifications on various system events. |
| `opencfpcentral.*`    | Settings related to using OpenCFP Central for single-sign-on |
| `talk.categories.*`   | dbkey: Display Name mapping for your talk categories |
| `talk.types.*`        | dbkey: Display Name mapping for your talk types |
| `talk.levels.*`       | dbkey: Display Name mapping for your talk levels |


For example, if you wanted to setup Mailgun as your email provider, your mail configuration would look something like this:

```
mail:
    host: smtp.mailgun.org
    port: 587
    username: do-not-reply@cfp.myfancyconference.com
    password: "a1b2c3d4"
    encryption: tls
    auth_mode: ~
```

As the project migrates from using Eloquent to Doctrine you also need to edit the following files to ensure the database
credentials are correct, creating a version of the modified file in the same location but without the `.dist` suffix.

`resources/config/config_testing.yml.dist`
`resources/config/config_development.yml.dist`
`resources/config/config_production.yml.dist`


### [Running behind a trusted proxy](#run-trusted-proxy)

If you are running OpenCFP behind a proxy server which adds X-Forwarded-For headers (this could be a cloud based load balancer or a service such as Cloudflare) you will need to set the environment variable TRUST_PROXIES to true this will ensure that OpenCFP trusts the headers set by these proxies for the original IP address and ssl mode. Setting this will trust these headers regardless of where the original request originates, so it's advisable to either lock down your instance so that only the trusted proxy can access it or modify the list of trusted proxies in the index.php file to only include the ip addresses of your proxies.


### [Run Migrations](#run-migrations)

This project uses [Doctrine Migrations](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/migrations.html) to handle migrations. 

To run the existing migrations, make sure you are in the root directory for the project and run the following:

```
$ bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --env=<environment> 
```

where <environment> is one of `testing`, `development`, or `production`. The default environment is `development` 


### [Using Vagrant](#using-vagrant)

After running `$ composer run setup-env` (or `$ ./script/setup`) from the project root run `php vendor/bin/homestead make`. 
This will create a `Homestead.yaml` based on settings from `Homestead.yaml.example`. Do not version control `Homestead.yaml`

Run `vagrant up`
Add `192.168.10.10 opencfp.test` to your operating system's hosts file (/etc/hosts)
Point your browser to `http://opencfp.test`

Edit your `config/development.yml` to use Homestead's database & mail settings:

```
database:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  database: cfp
  dsn: mysql:dbname=cfp;host=127.0.0.1
  user: homestead
  password: secret

log:
  level: debug

mail:
  host: localhost
  port: 1025
  username: ~
  password: ~
  encryption: ~
  auth_mode: ~
```

Mailhog (local mail catching) can be viewed at http://opencfp.test:8025

For more usage information please see the [Laravel Homestead Docs](http://laravel.com/docs/homestead)

You also need to edit the following files for Doctrine support



### [Final Touches](#final-touches)

 * The web server must be able to write to the directories:
    * `/web/uploads`
    * `/cache/:environment` (e.g. `/cache/production`)
    * `/log`
 * You may need to alter the `memory_limit` of the web server to allow image processing of head-shots. This is largely
   dictated by the size of the images people upload. Typically 512M works.
 * Customize templates and `/web/assets/css/app.css` to your heart's content.

### [Building Docker Image](#building-docker-image)


#### What is Docker

Quoting [OpenSource](https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker):

"[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 
Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and 
other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, 
the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized 
settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code."

#### Requirements

1. You will need to download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) locally.
2. You will need to download and install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) too.

#### Build & Run the image

OpenCfp provides a ready-to-use docker-compose.yml file.

Instead of updating the *ENV_PROD*.yaml.dist file to set your environment, with the docker file, you only have to put the environment variables in the docker-compose.override.yml file wich will override the default configuration.

Don't forget to edit **the /config/docker.yml.dist file**  at **the application level** to define your own configuration (Like the title, email or the event location or the event date). We **recommand** you to only modify the **application level** of this file, the other levels are automaticly set with environment variables provide in the *docker-compose.yml*.

You also have to change the values named *changeMe* to truly define the environment variables:
```
services :
  php:
    environment:
      - CFP_DB_HOST=database
      - CFP_DATABASE=opencfp
      - CFP_DB_PASS=changeMe
      - CFP_DB_USER=opencfp
      - MAIL_HOST=~
      - MAIL_PORT=~ 
      - MAIL_USERNAME=~
      - MAIL_PASSWORD=~
      - MAIL_ENCRYPTION=~
      - MAIL_AUTH_MODE=~
      - ADMIN_NAME=changeMe
      - ADMIN_LAST_NAME=changeMe
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeMe
      - ADMIN_EMAIL=changeMe@changeMe
```
which will be useful values for the creation of a development administrator.

**Quick explanation of the environment variables :**

 - The environment variables named *CFP_** are use to set the connection with the database.
 - The environment variables named *MAIL_** are use to set the mail provider. This values are not mandatory.
 - The environment variables name *ADMIN_** are use to create the admin account in development or test environment. If an admin user already exist the initialisation processus will warn you but will keep going his initialisation. You can ignore this warn message if you already made a previus docker build.

If you need to add configuration options specific to your working environment (network ...) add them to a docker-compose.override.yml file.See [this link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#understanding-multiple-compose-files) to learn more about that.

Then you can build the docker images by using a [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) command which will build the images, create an admin user in development or test environment, compiling the Frontend Assets and run the containers automatically for you:

```
$  docker-compose up
```
This command starts the following services:

| Name        | Description                                                                | Port(s)            | Environment(s)                                   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| nodejs          | A nodejs container to compil css                                                | n/a               | all      |
| database          | A MySQL 5.7 database server                                                | 3306               | all (prefer using a managed service in prod) |
| php         | The OpenCfp project with PHP, PHP-FPM 7.4, Composer and sensitive configs     | n/a                | all                                              |
| nginx       | The HTTP server for the OpenCfp project (NGINX)                               | 8080               | all                                              |

<details>
  <summary>To see the status of the containers, run:</summary>

  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>To run any command in the app container you can use the docker-compose exec command:</summary>

  ```bash
  docker-compose exec <container name> <command>
  docker-compose exec php sh # To enter the container directly, you will be placed at the root of the project
  docker-compose exec php bin/console cache:clear # To execute a cache:clear with the php console
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>To see the container's logs, run:</summary>

  ```bash
  docker-compose logs        # display the logs of all containers
  docker-compose logs -f     # same but follow the logs
  docker-compose logs -f <container_name> # follow the logs for one container
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>To rebuild the containers:</summary>

  ```bash
  docker-compose build        # Rebuild all the containers
  ```
</details>

Once the containers are up, you will have to add an administrator for the website.
To do that you only have to execute 

```sh

docker-compose exec php bin/console user:create --first_name="CHANGE_HERE" --last_name="CHANGE_HERE" --email="CHANGE_HERE" --password="CHANGE_HERE" --admin

```

After the execution of this command you will see : 

```sh
OpenCFP
=======

Creating User
-------------

 * created user with login *login you passed*
 * promoted user to admin

                                                                                
 [OK] User Created   

```

Now everything is set and ready to use. Go to localhost:8080 to see OpenCfp runnig. 

To know how to use a docker-compose file in production, see [this documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/production/).

#### Access MySQL container

To access the MySQL container from outside the application container you can use the following information:

- **Host**: 127.0.0.1
- **User**: (the user name credential you provided in the docker-compose.yml file)
- **Password**: (the user password credential you provided in the docker-compose.yml file) 
 

_PS_: You can always modify the file `docker-compose.override.yml` and have your own setup. See [this link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#understanding-multiple-compose-files) to learn more about that.


## [Command-line Utilities](#command-line-utilities)

OpenCFP comes bundled with a few command-line utilities to administer the system. A full list of commands (along with help for each)
can be found by running the following in the project root:

```
$ bin/console
```

### [Admin Group Management](#admin-group-management)

Administrators are authorized to review speaker information in addition to specifying talk favorites and making selections.

Adding `speaker@opencfp.org` to the admin group:

```
$ bin/console user:promote --env=production speaker@opencfp.org admin
```

Removing `speaker@opencfp.org` from the admin group:

```
$ bin/console user:demote --env=production speaker@opencfp.org admin
```

### [Reviewer Group Management](#reviewer-group-management)
Reviewers are authorized to see talks and give ratings to them.

Adding `speaker@opencfp.org` to the reviewer group:

```
$ bin/console user:promote --env=production speaker@opencfp.org reviewer
```

Removing `speaker@opencfp.org` from the reviewer group:

```
$ bin/console user:demote --env=production speaker@opencfp.org reviewer
```


### [User Management](#user-management)

Users are needed for you system, and sometimes you want to add users via command line.

Adding a speaker:

```
$ bin/console user:create --first_name="Speaker" --last_name="Name" --email="speaker@opencfp.org" --password="somePassw0rd!"
```

Add an admin:

```
$ bin/console user:create --first_name="Admin" --last_name="Name" --email="admin@opencfp.org" --password="somePassw0rd!" --admin
```

Add a reviewer:

```
$ bin/console user:create --first_name="Admin" --last_name="Name" --email="admin@opencfp.org" --password="somePassw0rd!" --reviewer
```

### [Clear Caches](#clear-caches)

OpenCFP uses Twig as a templating engine and HTML Purifier for input filtering. Both of these packages maintain a cache.
If you need to clear all application caches:

```
$ bin/console cache:clear
```

### [Scripts to Rule Them All](#scripts-rule-all)

OpenCFP follows the [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern. This allows
for an easy to follow convention for common tasks when developing applications.

#### Initial Setup
This command will install all dependencies, run database migrations, and alert you of any missing configs.

```
$ composer run setup-env
```

#### Update Application
This command will update all dependencies and run new migrations

```
$ composer run update-env
```

#### Run Tests
This command will run the PHPUnit test suite using distributed phpunit config, `phpunit.xml.dist`, if
no phpunit.xml is found in the root.

```
$ composer run test
```

## [Compiling Frontend Assets](#compiling-frontend-assets)

OpenCFP ships with a pre-compiled CSS file. However, we now include the Sass / PostCSS used to compile front-end assets. You are free to modify these source files to change brand colors or modify your instance however you see fit. Remember, you can do **nothing** and take advantage of the pre-compiled CSS we ship. You only need these instructions if you want to customize or contribute to the look and feel of OpenCFP. Let's take a look at this new workflow for OpenCFP.

Install Node dependencies using `yarn`.

```bash
yarn install
```

Now dependencies are installed and we're ready to compile assets. Check out the `scripts` section of `package.json`. A normal development workflow is to run either `yarn run watch` or `yarn run watch-poll` (for OS that don't have `fs-events`) and begin work. When you make changes to Sass files, Webpack will recompile assets, but it doesn't compress the output. To do that, run `yarn run prod` (an alias for `yarn run production`). This will run the same compilation, but will compress the output.

The main `app.scss` file is at [`resources/assets/sass/app.scss`](resources/assets/sass/app.scss). We use [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix) to compile our Sass. Mix is configurable to run without Laravel, so we take advantage of that because it really makes dealing with Webpack a lot simpler. Our Mix configuration is at [`webpack.mix.js`](webpack.mix.js). In it, we run our `app.scss` through a Sass compilation step, we copy FontAwesome icons and finally run the compiled CSS through [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), a PostCSS plugin.

TailwindCSS is a new utility-first CSS framework that uses CSS class composition to piece together interfaces. Check out [their documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/) for more information on how to use the framework. We use it extensively across OpenCFP and it saves a lot of time and keeps us from having to maintain *too much* CSS. If you take a look through our `app.scss`, you'll see a lot of calls to [`@apply`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply). This is NOT a Sass construct. It's a TailwindCSS function used to mixin existing classes into our custom CSS.

## [Testing](#testing)

There is a test suite that uses PHPUnit in the /tests directory. To set up
your environment for testing:

1. Create a testing database, and update the name and credentials in
   /config/testing.yml
2. The recommended way to run the tests is:

```
$ composer run test
```

The default phpunit.xml.dist file is in the root directory for the project.

## [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

**I'm getting weird permissions-related errors to do with HTML Purifier.**

You may need to edit directory permissions for some vendor packages such as HTML Purifier. Check the `/cache` directory's
permissions first.
