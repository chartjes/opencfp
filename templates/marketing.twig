            {{ site.title }} is committed to creating a conference that is as inclusive as possible.
            We want to showcase talent available in South Florida along with fostering beginning
            speakers. We are also happy to welcome international speakers, but the numbers
            are limited by our ability to cover expenses.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            We are also committed to ensuring the conference is a place
            where ideas are exchanged, old friends get together, new friends meet and <strong>harassment
            is not tolerated</strong>. We expect speakers and attendees to be professional and courteous to
            each other. We reserve the right to remove, without refund, ANY attendee (speaker or otherwise)
            who is unable to adhere to these ideals.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            We look forward to seeing what ideas you want to share with us this year!
